rdrop.ipynb:
	this code calculates total number of atoms and creates a ".csv" files for a particular radius of drop.
	Inputs in the code are the number of variation of temperature and for each variation of temperature, code inputs the contact angle and surface density and determines the number of atoms for a number of observations of radius of drop.
